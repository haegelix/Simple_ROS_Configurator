#Install Guide
## Ubuntu 20.04 - by install script
You can directly run the setup script by
```
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haegelix/ros2_ui/main/installation/scripts/install.sh)
```
Note: It's bad practice to run code without checking it before. So please check it out.

Or you could just go visit the file and run the code line by line. [Follow this link](installation/scripts/install.sh) 
```

```
